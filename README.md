Making History: Transcribe
=====================

Transcribe is built upon the open-source generosity of George Mason University's [Center for History and New Media] (http://chnm.gmu.edu/) and was an original creation by the amazing staff at [The University of Iowa Libraries] (http://www.lib.uiowa.edu/). Their project, DIYHistory|transcribe, can be found at [http://diyhistory.lib.uiowa.edu/] (http://diyhistory.lib.uiowa.edu/) with their github repository located at [github.com/ui-libraries] (https://github.com/ui-libraries). The Library of Virginia made changes to UI-Libraries solution all of which can be found within one of the two following github repositories: [plugin-Scripto] (https://github.com/LibraryofVA/plugin-Scripto) and [Scribe] (https://github.com/LibraryofVA/omeka-themes/tree/master/scribe). The Library of Virginia has also deployed a self built [Omeka Export plugin] (https://github.com/LibraryofVA/plugin-Export) that retrieves the transcription text from Omeka in a format ready to be imported into our digital asset management system.

##Overview
[Making History - Transcribe] (http://www.virginiamemory.com/transcribe/) is a tool for engaging users in transcribing handwritten documents, making them more searchable and enhancing them for research. Transcribe is built on the [Omeka] (http://omeka.org/) content management system and uses the [Scripto] (http://scripto.org/) plugin to facilitate transcription. [Scripto] (http://scripto.org/) uses [MediaWiki] (http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki), which allows users to continually improve upon work that has already been done. UI-Libraries made significant additions to the Scripto plugin, created a new Omeka theme, and customized other Omeka plugins to style and scale for a library production environment.
